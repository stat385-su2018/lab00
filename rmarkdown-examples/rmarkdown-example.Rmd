### Overview

Within this lab, we'll be taking a look at how to write RMarkdown in
addition to the appropriate structure for relative and absolute
paths. In particular, we'll focus on how to link
to an image file and read in a sample data set.

#### Markdown Formatting

##### Styling

Write an unordered list of your classes this semester.

1. When writing the short course name (e.g. STAT 385) make it bold. 
1. Create a link so that when the short course name is clicked it 
   will take you to the course description in the course explorer. 
1. Make the long title (Statistics Programming Methods) italic.

If you need help with syntax, go to the "Help" menu and select the 
_Markdown Quick Reference_ guide. This will open in the **Help** tab on
the _lower-right_ corner of _RStudio_.

The course explorer is found here: 
<https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2018/spring/STAT>

##### Making _R_ Code Work

The following _R_ code will error when the document is first knit:

```r
# install.packages("ggplot2")
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
     geom_point()
```

The error is:

```r
Error in ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) : could not find function "ggplot"
```

Fix the code chunk by:

1. Installing the `ggplot2` if it isn't already installed
    - Please uncomment, e.g. delete `#`, to install and then recomment the code, e.g. add `#` back.
2. Load the package `ggplot2` using the `library()` function.
3. Make the code chunk _dynamic_.

##### Mathematics

**A helpful resource for looking up mathematical symbols can be found at:
<https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Symbols>**

**Welcome to LaTeX**

Write the equation for the [Pythagorean Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem)
in both display centered and inline. (Hint `$` vs. `$$`)

**Challenging**

Provide the equation for the [Golden Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio)
in display centered. 

_Hints:_

- Fractions are written as: `\frac{numerator}{denominator}`
- Square roots are given by: `\sqrt{quantity}`
- If you would like, the symbol for phi is given by: `\phi`


**Advanced**

Write the mathematical equation for the quadratic equation in latex.

_Hints:_

- Plus or Minus symbol is given by: `\pm` 



##### Tables

Recreate the following data table in markdown:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
health_infection = matrix(c(12, 37, 50, 9), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(health_infection) = c("Male", "Female")
colnames(health_infection) = c("HIV-", "HIV+")
knitr::kable(health_infection)
```


#### Paths

##### Relative Paths

Relative paths are based on where the current working directory is pointing to.
They lack any reference to the "root" of the file system.

```md
![File is in the same directory as RMarkdown document](block-i.png)
![File is in the img directory underneath where the RMarkdown document is](img/block-i-subfolder.png)
```

Note, if we allow these markdown snippets to run, we'll get:

![File is in the same directory as RMarkdown document](block-i.png)
![File is in the img directory underneath where the RMarkdown document is](img/block-i-subfolder.png)


The working directory is displayed immediately underneath the _R_ **Console**
tab in the lower-left corner of _RStudio_.

To figure out the working directory of this document type: 

```{r}
getwd()
```

###### Goal:

Write _relative_ paths for:

- `rstudio-logo.png`
- `r-logo.png`
- `cloud-data.csv`

##### Absolute or Fixed Paths

Absolute or fixed paths are based on the relation of the file to the
"root" of the file system. These paths are traditional very long and 
cause code used on two different computers to break.

```md
![MacOS Absolute Path](/Users/jjb/rmarkdown-examples/block-i.png)
![Windows Absolute Path](C:/Users/balamut2/Documents/rmarkdown-examples/block-i.png)
![Linux Absolute Path](/home/parallel/rmarkdown-examples/block-i.png)
![RStudio Cloud Absolute Path](/home/rstudio-user/rmarkdown-examples/block-i.png)
```

Do not use these types of file paths in your _RMarkdown_ file! This will
cause us to be unable to recreate your output or results document. 

###### Goal:

Write _absolute_ paths for _Windows_, _MacOS_, and _Linux_:

- `rstudio-logo.png`
- `r-logo.png`
- `cloud-data.csv`

Hint: Open the file location in your file explorer or type `getwd()` to get
the base of the directory.
